## What is this site?

This site is a template that can be easily modified to fit your needs. It is very flexible and consists of HTML, Markdown, JavaScript, and CSS. Since it is based on Jekyll, the site also uses Liquid.

This template falls under the MIT License, which can also be found in the root of the repository.

If you have any questions about the implemented features or how to implement a feature, please contact me to discuss it further.

Comprehensive documentation of the project can be found in the About section of the site, and it is also available in the assets directory in the root of the repository.
